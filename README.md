## Getting Started

Welcome to your new Nuxt 4 application! This project is built with Nuxt version `4.0.1`, offering a streamlined development experience and powerful features for building modern web applications.
To begin developing with this Nuxt 4 project, you'll typically start by removing the default welcome page.

1.  **Remove the Welcome Page:**
    Locate the `<NuxtWelcome/>` component in your `app.vue` file and replace it with your own application code.

    ```html
    <!-- app.vue -->
    <template>
      <div>
        <!-- Replace <NuxtWelcome/> with your main application component or layout -->
        <NuxtLayout>
          <NuxtPage />
        </NuxtLayout>
      </div>
    </template>
    ```
